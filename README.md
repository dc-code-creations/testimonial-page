### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

- I tried to make the star rating section smaller by adding some padding to the top and bottom of the section, however when I did this, it would warp the company logo, too. Ultimately, I decided to add an equal amount ofpadding to the top and bottom of the company logo as well, and that seems to have resolved the issue. I am not wure whether this is the best way to do it or not, but it works well enough for what I need it to do.

### Useful resources

<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [list-style misalignment issue](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/css-list-style-image-vertical-alignment-issue/5242) - When alter the list style for the unordered list, I found that the bullet points were no longer aligned with the text. This post (as well as this one [second list-style post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14709538/aligning-list-style-image-proportionally-with-text)) helped me figure out how to get the bullet point decorations to be aligned with the text
